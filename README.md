# Overview

The web application is to help players explore and build Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG) decks. The app will allow users to upload CSV files containing card data, display that data in a searchable and filterable catalog table, and analyze which cards synergize well in a 60-card deck.


# Core Features (MVP):

[ ] CSV Upload: Drag-and-drop or file picker to upload Pokémon card CSV files.

[ ] Data Parsing & Storage: Normalize and persist card data for use in the frontend.

[ ] Catalog Table View: Interactive table to display card details (e.g., HP, moves, type).

[ ] Filtering System: Filters by Pokémon type, move, energy cost, etc.

[ ] Frontend Deployment: Live web app hosted on Vercel.


# Future Enhancements

[ ] Deck Builder Tool: Select cards into a virtual deck and get stats.

[ ] Synergy Engine: Recommend cards that work well together based on type/move/energy.

[ ] User Accounts: Save decks and upload history.

[ ] Mobile-Friendly UI: Responsive design for phones and tablets.

[ ] Export/Sharing: Export decks to CSV or shareable links.
